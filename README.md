University of Helsinki Full-Stack MOOC - https://fullstackopen.com/en/about

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the application’s data.

The course is worth 3-8 credits, and the content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2019. There is also an associated project work that is worth 1-10 credits.
